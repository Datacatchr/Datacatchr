# DataCatchr

## Project Description
This is a data platform that will make it easier to build personal dashboards and to collect the data for them. If you could wave a magic wand and get insight into any aspect of your life, what would you choose? We are building the tools to let you track what is most important uniquely to you, and use it gain greater insight into your life.

## How to Install and Run the Project
Right now, everything is in this repo.

## How to Use the Project
The first version will be an advanced time tracking tool that takes the data you collect and automatically adds it graph showing how close you are to your goal.

## ROADMAP
Levels of completion:
DONE | WORKING | NEEDS WORK | FRAMED | DESIGNED | IDEA | IDEATING
### 1. Build a platform that lets people use tool/package combos to collect their own data and visualize it
1. Add a speech to text functionality 
2. Add comments to code
3. Create documentation
4. Create a way for people to submit bugs
5. Create a feature to let users export data as CSV
6. Come up with connection-primitives like Time (other examples might be location, device collected on, etc.) that will be able to 
7. Build a set of tool primitives that can be used in collection interfaces and help people build their own tool
8. Add a 'like' feature to the tools; show that count on the tool in the library and order by count; add a search feature so users can find tools by name
9. Switch to application factory
10. Create place for community to make  and upvote suggestions
12. Create ability to save direct access to tools as icons on mobile
13. ==Figure out how to create a new table for each user as they use a new tool==
14. ==Figure out how to keep user data separate==
15. ==Make sure the data is secure==
16. 

### 2. Build a way for people to build their own tools, and download other people's tools; transition to "Mobile First"
1. Let people build their own tools
2. Add analytics (GA4/Mixpanel) so we can see what features people are using
3. Let people download tools from the library
4. Let people add and remove tools from their home page
5. 
	
### 3. Build a data studio that lets people edit current tools in a UI and edit their data from a UI; build a desktop UI
1. Feature that has sponsored templates (the Huberman template, the Ferriss template, etc)
2. Let people customize tools that already exist
3. Let people design their Dashboard
4. Develop the "crypto business model"
5. Add functionality to let people sell their apps and data viz?
	
### 4. Data rollup that lets people import their data from other sources and that pulls data from public sources==
	1. Create a way to use AI to autogenerate charts, and to automatically generate the code to connect to the database table 
	2. Create a GraphDB to start connecting data
	3. Create workflows to automate the process of pulling 
	4. Start creating a crypto for this (Also create a DAO?)
	
### 5. Give people the option to store their data on Filecoin and personally own their own data
	1. __
	
### 6. Create ways for people to moetize their data; transition to "Crypto First"
	1. __
